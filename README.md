# Scheduler for on-campus jobs 
## Concept:
- As an international student, I can work on a part time job at my University for only 20 hours/week.
- Even if I have multiple jobs the maximum number of hours can be 20 
- The idea behind this scheduler is that I can add my schedule for each job and check for any schedule conflicts 

## User Stories
- User can add events to their schedule
- User can view their schedule 
- User can edit events 
- User can delete events
- User will get a schedule conflict whenever there is an overlapping event

## Concept of Schedule Conflict 
- User will be notified when max number of hours have been reached 
- User will be notified when trying to add an overlapping event 
- Back to Back events
